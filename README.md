# NGOWebsite
This Project includes a Website designed for SORAD, Society of Research and Development, a Rajasthan based Non Goverment Organisation. The Website uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The Website is highly responsive, with an interactive user interface, and has multiple sections!
The Project is a Freelance Web Development Project I undertook for the NGO.
